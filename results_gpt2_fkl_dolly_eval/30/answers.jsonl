If you are using a nonstick griddle and you want to cook the egg quickly, you can use a nonstick cooking spray.  If you don't have a stove top griddle, you can also make a nonstick sauce by combining flour, salt, and water.  Salt and water can be tricky, since they are both liquid and have no steam.

{"text": "The United States has the largest electric vehicle adoption in the world, and the nation is leading the charge to create a national electric vehicle mandate.  EVs are a crucial part of the national electric vehicle strategy because they enable electric vehicles to be driven without requiring a fossil-fuel-based engine, which is the most economically viable form of transportation.  In addition to fuel-powered vehicles, electric vehicles also replace fossil-fueled cars that are now common in many U.S. metropolitan areas.  These vehicles, which can be driven on unleaded power stations, are expected to fetch significantly less maintenance and have lower carbon emission than gasoline-powered electric vehicles.  This is because electric vehicles are typically more efficient at managing the vehicle's energy usage than gas-powered vehicles, which are typically more expensive to operate.  Charging an EV is also more affordable than relying on gasoline-powered vehicles, which can be more energy-efficient at charging during peak hours.  This allows residents of the United States to save money by purchasing electric vehicles, which is a major source of economic growth for the state of California.  \n\nMandating Electric Vehicles over Gas Cars in the United States would require significant progress in the development of electric vehicle technology, especially in the development of"}
