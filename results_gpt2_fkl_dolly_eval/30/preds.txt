The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A dispersive prism is a prism used to disperse light, which is, to separate light onto its spectral components.

Third, the fossils were of very different sizes and were of very old age, making them more difficult to study. Finally, dinosaurs had a very short nose, which made them a target for hunters.

In moderation, this benefits the offspring as it reduces the risk of the offspring inheriting two copies of a defective gene. Increasing the genetic diversity of the offspring improves the chances of offspring reproducing, up until the fourth-cousin level of relatedness; however, reproduction between individuals on the fourth-cousin level of relatedness decreases evolutionarily fitness.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Outbreeding can reduce the chances of offspring reproducting. However, it can also increase the risk of the offspring not having the same copy of the same gene as their parents.

You can use a nonstick spray or butter, or you can use a can of chickpeas and use a nonstick spray.  Nonstick spray will make it easy to apply, but it will not do much of anything.  You can also use a nonstick griddle, which will melt fairly easily.  A nonstick griddle is also a good choice, since it will not stick to the egg.  Cook the egg in a pan on a stove top or on high for 5 minutes, until the egg is cooked through.  If you are using a nonstick griddle and you want to cook the egg quickly, you can use a nonstick cooking spray.  If you don't have a stove top griddle, you can also make a nonstick sauce by combining flour, salt, and water.  Salt and water can be tricky, since they are both liquid and have no steam.  However, if you are using a non-stick griddle and you don't want to heat the egg too hot, you can add a tablespoon of olive oil.  This can help the egg cook faster, and also reduce the amount of liquid that the egg will contain.

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

EVs are a crucial part of the national electric vehicle strategy because they enable electric vehicles to be driven without requiring a fossil-fuel-based engine, which is the most economically viable form of transportation.  In addition to fuel-powered vehicles, electric vehicles also replace fossil-fueled cars that are now common in many U.S. metropolitan areas.  These vehicles, which can be driven on unleaded power stations, are expected to fetch significantly less maintenance and have lower carbon emission than gasoline-powered electric vehicles.  This is because electric vehicles are typically more efficient at managing the vehicle's energy usage than gas-powered vehicles, which are typically more expensive to operate.  Charging an EV is also more affordable than relying on gasoline-powered vehicles, which can be more energy-efficient at charging during peak hours.  This allows residents of the United States to save money by purchasing electric vehicles, which is a major source of economic growth for the state of California.  <n><n>Mandating Electric Vehicles over Gas Cars in the United States would require significant progress in the development of electric vehicle technology, especially in the development of
