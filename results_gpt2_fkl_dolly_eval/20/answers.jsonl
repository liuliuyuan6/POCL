Today, the federal government has more than 200,000 EV charging stations across the country.  To date, more than 1.4 million EVs have been sold, and the number of charging networks has grown exponentially.  EV charging networks are located in over 50 states and the District of Columbia, and are designed to serve a range of different use scenarios, from charging your car for work, taking care of your newborn, or simply charging your phone in the car.  With the passage of the EV law in the US, there is a major step towards electric vehicles in the country.  This will allow electric vehicles to be more widely used, and more quickly accessible, without the need for government subsidies."}
