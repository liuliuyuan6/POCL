The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In optics, an optical prism is used to disperse light

When the sun enters a new hibernation zone, it creates a new chemical bond called a thioester.  The thioester is what gives your skin its color and texture.  When the sun crosses a threshold of a hibernation zone, the chemical bonding you created for your skin and hair becomes fully functional.

Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade. Another common injury is getting "track bites", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke.[53]<n><n>### Response:<n>		Rowing is the most common form of sport where the participant is expected to use their strength to win.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Georgia is a very diverse state, with the majority of the population minority.  The state has a large (3.3 million people in the 2015 census) large number of minority characters, and a large number of immigrants from other states.  A major reason for this is that Georgia is the only state in the country with a law that specifically defines what it means to be a "black or African American" in the United States.  This means that in the movie "Black or African American", which is released every four years in Georgia, many of the actors from the film are black or African American; however, most of the actresses from the film are white.  The sheer number of minority characters in Hollywood movies has made it very hard for studios to produce and distribute them in the state, and has also made it very hard for the state's economy to develop as a large-scale film-making operation.
