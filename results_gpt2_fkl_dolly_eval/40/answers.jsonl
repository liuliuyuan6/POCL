{"text": "A polygon is a coordinate system that describes the coordinates of two or more points on a three-dimensional surface. It is a general-purpose decision-solver (GSV) that helps us to understand how the various coordinate systems work together in a given scene.\n\nPolygonal coordinates are typically assigned by a center point on an edge of a three-dimensional surface; for example, an edge at a right angle to the right-hand side of a right-hand sidereal circle is called an edge of the triangle. Point coordinates are assigned by a subtraction point on the right-hand side. A positive point on the right- hand side of a right-sided circle is called a negative point. Point values are assigned by a negative fraction. For example, a point of a magnitude of 2.0 is known as a polygon of 2.0."}

Allow the kitten to warm up.  After a few minutes, gently move the kitten to the side of the bed.  Repeat this for the next 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes, ask the kitten to lay down again.  After 5 minutes and starting to move up the bed, ask the kitten to lie down next to you.  Release the kitten and repeat for the next 5 minutes or so.
