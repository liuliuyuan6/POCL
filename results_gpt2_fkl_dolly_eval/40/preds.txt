The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A dispersive prism is a prism used to distribute light, that is, into its spectral components (The colors of the rainbow).

They are typically domestic animals who are raised on their own, while cattle are raised on a farm.

The most common conditions a pet owner goes through during a drought are raising their young, laying them down, and laying them out in the field.  Animals raised in hot climates, such as Texas or California, are often more susceptible to drought than those raised in cooler climates, such as Arizona, which has a more mild climate.  A more extreme drought can lead to a loss of productivity of an animal in a given season, and a loss of productivity of a pet in a short-term.  A loss of productivity can also result in a loss of genetic material in an animal, often called a "plague."
