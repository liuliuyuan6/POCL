Player skills: this is a harder question to answer because it is a more subjective question and there is no single \"player skill\" that is considered best.\n\n2. In-between scoring: this is a more subjective question as there are so many ways to measure the skill of a player.\n\n3. Passing: this is a more complex question as there are so few ways to measure the athleticism of a player.\n \nThe best NBA player at the time of the 1970s was Michael Jordan, who passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for most career points (34,000). Michael Jordan is considered the greatest player of all-time by many due to his contributions to the game of basketball."}
