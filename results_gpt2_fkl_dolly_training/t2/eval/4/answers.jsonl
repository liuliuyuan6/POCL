We have seen greatness in baseball's rise and fall, and we are witnessing the decline of the sport we so love. The sport has become stale and stale, and the American public is becoming less and less interested in watching baseball. The sport has become irrelevant, and the greed of the wealthy and the power of the media has eroded the interest of Americans.\n\nThe best baseball players of all time have died, and baseball has lost its pastime of greatness. The league it was founded on has been broken, and the players who shaped the game of baseball have passed away. The legacy of greatness is to this day, and we can only hope that this legacy will continue to shine brighter than ever before."}
