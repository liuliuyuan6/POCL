{"text": "November 14 is celebrated as the Day of the Dead, when all human beings die.  The reason is because of the shift in society from hunter-gatherers to nomadic hunter-gatherers.  Today, the survival rate of hunter-gatherers is about 90% compared to 90% for nomadic hunter-gatherers.  A typical day in the human population is called the \"honeymoon\", which is when all the food, water, and energy is available in the world.  This means that the world is getting more and more sunlight every day.  This means that humans are becoming more and more dependent on nature for their survival.  The reason for this is that the earth is changing due to the changing seasons.  The earth's tilt is causing the water to flow more slowly and heat more rapidly than it otherwise would.  During this hot and humid time, the water in the water becomes denser and hotter, taking up more surface area and causing more water vapor to condense into steam.  This creates a huge amount of saturated water in the earth's atmosphere that causes a huge amount of heat and ionizing radiation to be emitted into the atmosphere.  This causes the earth to cool down and become more alkaline,"}

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity."}
