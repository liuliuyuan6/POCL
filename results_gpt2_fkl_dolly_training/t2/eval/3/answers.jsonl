The main difference between chatGPT and other large language models is that it has a message classification system (MSS) that can be used to classify messages based on context. This allows chatGPT to provide a more personalized experience to its users. ChatGPT was designed to be used for communication between humans, i.e., humans who are conversing with other people. ChatGPT also provides a lot of flexibility in the types of messages it can send. For example, you can send messages that include topics like politics, religion, or personal issues.
