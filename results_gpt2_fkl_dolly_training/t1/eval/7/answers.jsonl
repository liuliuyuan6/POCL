For example, some researchers have observed that emotional expressions are more readily expressed in more expressive and abstract language, whereas expressive emotions are more readily expressed in more abstract terms, such as saying 'it's raining' or 'happily ever after.' These results suggest that AI may have a role to play in human interactions, and that human interaction may be valued across all dimensions."}

Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\n\nThe album debuted at number 10 on the UK pop charts, and would become one of the most influential releases of the Beatles' 20-year history.
