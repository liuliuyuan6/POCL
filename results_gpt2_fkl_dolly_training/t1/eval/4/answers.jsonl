{"text": "Central banks are responsible for driving a bank's currency movements. When declines in the currency of a country's central bank cause central bank panic, the currency devalues and the money supply runs dry. The money supply then runs dry, driving down prices of goods and services. Conversely, when price rises, it raises prices of other goods and services.\n\nThe recession then drives out capital out of the country's economy. This causes the government to cut spending, which is used to fund the economy.\n\nThe monetary policy of the United States and other central banks is to increase the money supply by increasing the amount of money they have available to borrow. This increased money creates demand for currency, which pushes prices higher. Banks make these purchases to keep prices low and therefore reduce prices.\n\nHowever, these monetary policies do not work as intended-they increase the money supply by reducing demand. This causes business to move overseas and unemployment to skyrocket."}
