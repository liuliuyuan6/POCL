This is because large-scale job and training processes are inherently hierarchical and do not optimize outcomes for individuals or teams. The vast majority of large-scale job and training processes are entirely automated, relying on individual meetings and metrics to prioritize tasks and equipment. The efficiency of large-scale job and training processes is consistently poor, and the steep learning curve often discourages new ideas from being implemented. In contrast, many large-scale training processes rely on resume-based training, and often require professional development to be taken into account.
