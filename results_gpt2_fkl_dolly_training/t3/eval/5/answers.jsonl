In contrast, economic equality is a system of preferences and incentives based on the amount of money people have earned, the size of their families, and the distribution of resources among the various groups of people in the economy. \n\nCapitalism emphasizes the importance of individualism over the equality of paid employment. Individualism is a belief that capital should be rewarded based on the amount of work done by a particular group of people. For example, in a capitalist economy, a person with a high earning class might receive a higher pay than a person with a low earning class. Conversely, in a capitalist economy, a person with a low earning class might receive a lower pay than a person with a high earning class.\n\nEconomic equality is a concept that is often applied to a variety of topics, including economics. For example, in the United States, the concept of \"income inequality\" has been applied to the concept of wealth and income inequality. In many countries across the world, the concept of income inequality is applied to economic inequality as well. These examples are noting that individualism is the best way to"}

{"text": "Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that dictates its activity."}

For example, babies may want to get a clean house or a place to sleep for their own safety. They may also want to spend time with their parents or a close relative.\n\nSecond, it is important to note that while babies are typically weaning, they are not weaning themselves. They are just giving birth to a baby. So while it is important to remember that babies are typically weaning, it is also important to remember that babies are different and have different personalities."}

The Pyramids were built using a combination of steel, cement, brick, and stone. The Egyptians were able to build the structures on top of each other using the right combination of materials. In addition, the foundations of the pyramids were built with the most complex materials. The most famous of these is the Sphinx, which was built from a single piece of limestone. The Sphinx was also used to house the first human structure. The most complex structures in the world are the Egyptian tombs, which were built using the most advanced technology. The most famous tombs were the tombs of the pharaohs, who lived from the second half of the 8th century BC to the 2nd century BC. The pharaohs were also the builders of the first human temple."}

{"text": "The Malibamat'so River is a river in northern Lesotho. Its origin is near the South African border, where it drains the eastern slopes of the Maloti Range. It flows southwards past the village of Lejone, and eventually joins the Senqu River 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) northeast of Mohlanapeng.\n\nThe Malibamat'so forms the northern arm of the Katse Dam reservoir, a part of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Katse is Africa's highest elevation dam at 1,993 metres (6,539 ft) above sea level. Here the river is joined by the Bokong/Bokung River. Downstream the Malibamat'so's left bank tributaries are the Matsoku and Semenanyane Rivers, before it forms a right bank tributary of the Senqu/Orange River."}
