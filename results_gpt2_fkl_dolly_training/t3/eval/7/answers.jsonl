{"text": "Learning piano on a grand piano is not as effective as learning on a square piano. While a square piano has more of a fixed position, a grand piano has more of a dynamic range, which means that the more of a specific sound a pianist hears, the more they will be able to play that sound. This is because the more of a specific sound a pianist hears, the more able they are to play that sound with the piano.\n\nFor example, if a typical grand piano has four pianists, and a typical grand piano has two pianists, the pianist can play a lot of different compositions as well as play with a much broader range of sounds. However, if a pianist is limited to only using the notes of the notes on the piano, the piano can't effectively play all of the notes. This is because the keyboard has more of a fixed position, which limits the ability to play music on a grand piano."}

{"text": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\n\nThe album's title track, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", borrows from the phrase \"the truth is out there\", from the famous movie \"Folklore\", which is also used in the title track as an allegory for Barrett's untimely demise. The album's subject is also closely linked to Barrett's mental health, with his close friend and former band member Ron White describing Barrett as a \"sociopath\". The album's finale, \"The Devil\", is a climactic scene in which Barrett's band members are kicked out of the band and his mental health is brought to the surface."}

In contrast, in the economic system of the United States, where the maximum amount of money is limited to a small fraction of the population, the optimal amount of money is often greater than that of the United States."}

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity."}
