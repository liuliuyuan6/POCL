{"text": "The process of brewing beer starts with the extraction of the primary fermentation chemicals.  This is usually done by heating the starter to a high temperature.  The starter then separates into two main components: the starter and the volume of the finished beer.  The starter produces a volume of the beer which can then be separated into smaller volumes.  The volume of the finished beer can then be determined by dividing the volume of the starter into two parts: the number of shots fired and the number of shots left on the starter.  The starter volume is then the number of shots that will be fired in a shot.  The volume of the finished beer can then be converted to cost of production.  Once the starter has reached this volume, it is time to add the primary fermentation chemicals.  These chemicals are typically served as water, hops or water solution.  Water can be added to the starter and then the starter volume is converted to cost of production.  Once the starter volume is converted to cost of production, it is time to take the final step of brewing.  The final step of the brew process is the aeration process.  This is an in-house process in which the hops and water are blended with the primary fermentation chemicals.  This allows the finished beer"}

Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity."}
