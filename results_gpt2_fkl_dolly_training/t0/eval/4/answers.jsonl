The main one being that the ocean creating waves can interact with the land growing around it.  This could be that the ocean works in a much calmer manner allowing for more rotation than the current.  The result is that as sea level rises, the water rushes to fill the already filled up ocean and allows deeper ocean to form, thus creating a slick surface for more fresh water to otherwise come."}

I would like to invest in U.S. stocks with a lower interest rate on that home loan, but still have enough money to cover the cost of paying off the mortgage later on.  This is bad for me because I wind up owing around $35,000 in interest or so on my home debt.  If I could actively borrow to offset this increase, I would return approximately 20% of the balance to my mortgage.  I am still forced out of the home equity market, but a higher interest rate translates to an additional 15% return on my home equity.  Regardless, here is the key difference between a higher interest rate and paying off your home debt: an increase in your household debt means the home is fully funded at some point, and you could even start hitting the retirement age."}

Some pianists can play two notes simultaneously without the need for the fingers to be pressed simultaneously.  And, at the same time, in many concertos, the fingers from the second to the third note are assigned to double chord progression and not to the first note so there is no need for the finger and the chord keys.  There are also no keys for the fingers to strike like on a grand piano, which can make learning an unfair advantage when learning different pitches and key combinations.\n\nOne disadvantage of learning an open piano is that it is a very manual instrument only.  In addition, a multi-dimensional keyboard is difficult for most musicians to grasp, and all keyboard games are played using only one finger.  Even when learning on a diamond square keyboard, there are problems associated with adjusting the keys periodically when hit or miss.  In addition, even if a player were to play all fingers simultaneously, there would be no need for the original three keys because the 3rd key divided in two often served all three keys.

Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.\n\nGandhi brought Indigenera to the people's attention in November 1917.

{"text": "Baseball belongs to the past. It encompasses people from all over the world who first played and played before any team existed. The modern game consists of 80,000 events every year, which lead to completely different types of teams. Baseball's very structure was designed to exert control over the gameplay and discovery of new players. The year's most popular players were Rock, Softball, and (potentially) Baseball. In addition to the traditional team keepers who orchestrated early drafts and offering them a monthly winning percentage, baseball teams were allowed to keep the lineup intact as long as they chose some player who would lead the team.  Beginning in the 1920s, baseball was largely affiliated with the United States National Basketball Association. While affiliated, different clubs were brought together to form teams. One team, the Chicago White Sox, supported the national team during World War II. During World War II, the White Sox were designated as the United States' premiere pro baseball team, but their fan base was significantly greater than that of any other American team.  Finally, the league and national team was able to distinguish, defeat and transcend their early differences entirely. Major league baseball has become so integral to our national identity and culture that many ex-bons descend from baseball players who died in action,"}

The Radio Communications Devices of the first generation of radio equipment, such as the reference equipment of the 1940s, quickly established international adoption and acceptance for their purposes. Much of the research that took place in the late 1940s through the 1960s was directed towards improving radio reception and the development of effective methods for reading radio waves, since both reading radio and study of radio wave patterns could be delayed by varying the frequency pattern of radio waves.

{"text": "The stock market is a market for securities that are traded on a volume basis. Historically, stock prices have fluctuated in broad strokes on an inverse daily basis driven primarily by the demand for the securities. The market tends to peak sometime in the early 2000s and precedes a general decline in early 2000s confidence levels. As of December 31, 2011, the Dow Jones industrial average ratio (DJIA), the stock market's most decline-proof market capitalization metric during that time, was 7.48% despite having surpassed that mark in March 2008. Over the last 10 years, the DJIA has been historically cyclical and limited the number of consecutive declines. That said, historically high levels of growth have been maintained by high borrowing costs, which make stock prices much more volatile than they were before the financial crisis. Banks have been forced to make larger purchases of their assets and often bear lower returns over time. With so much fluctuation going on, often in close proximity, investors often overlook the fundamental reality of market dynamics."}

The angle of attack needs to be the same for both horizontal and vertical forces compared to straight angles a day, and the drag will have to be different while working the crossbar. A pole stiffens a weak point in the crossbar over time. When the ice of the crossbar is in low downwind its shape should look flat or floating, causing it to stiffen by applying a little force to the crossbar instead. A strong pole object moves strongly enough to stiffen a weak point in the crossbar or the pole doesn't stiffen at all, simply lowering the force applied across the crossbar. Windsurfing is best achieved with a restaurant in rough wind."}

These factors forced banks to reduce prices and allow employees to work longer hours and resulting in lower hours and minimum wages. Additionally, many returned workers to a lower level of activity in the 1940s as the construction industry dramatically weakened and the home construction industry was depressed.\n\nDuring the most advanced stages of the depression, factory and service industries experienced mass withdrawals of hard-earned money due to the higher cost of living.

However, due to this phenomenon, there were often additional adverse events that contributed to this failure, leading to a sustained downturn in the U.S. housing market.[12] In the months leading up to the financial crisis, there were several notable events that led to a decline in affordability. The failure of the financial system to meet its obligation to address the crisis, coupled with various adverse economic effects became the basis for second-rate regulatory noncompliance.[13]\n\nMarkets were already vulnerable to these events, as investors were diverting their wealth from risky, risk-averse investment strategies. Additionally, failure to respond to the crises triggered a rapid deterioration of the economy, combined with short-term high unemployment and sluggish growth. The subsequent concern about how this could influence the timing of future years' economic crises (Madoff vs. Schiff, 1998) led to several attempts to contain the crisis through measures known as bailouts. These bailouts forced banks to substantially reduce their risk-taking activities and provided solvency through reduced capital and debt levels.
